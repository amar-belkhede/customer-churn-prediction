        Churn measures a company's loss in subscribers within a given period of time.
        Churn rates are applied to subscription-based businesses such as Telecommunications, OTT
        (Over
        The
        Top) streaming servicies, DTH (Direct To Home) providers, Cloud Computing services, etc.

        Churn rate helps businesses to identify the steps or stages when a customer will leave a
        service. It
        takes companies 6 times more investment in getting new customers than keeping their current
        customers. This is why analysis of Churn is an important business 💵 problem.
