    <h5 class="p-3 mb-2 bg-secondary text-white">Our suggestions to the company ‚úîÔ∏è</h5>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                The company needs to focus and encourage Long-term
                subscriptions. Monthly subscription plans can be improved as well.
            </li>
            <li>
                Customers should be encouraged to buy additional services like DSL in bundle packs as offers.
            </li>
            <li>
                As variables like gender and partner don't affect churn, the company shouldn't target
                this specific segment as a means to reduce churn.
            </li>
            <li>
                Senior Citizens should be provided additional support and plans (offers) to cater to their
                needs.
            </li>
