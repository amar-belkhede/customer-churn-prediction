                        People with monthly subscription tend to churn more than people with long term subscription
                        plans.

                    <li>
    
                        Additional services like DSL also reduce churn.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Churn is irrespective of gender and partner.

                    <li>
                        Variables like Total charges, Monthly contracts, Fibre optic internet services and Seniority can
                        lead to higher churn rates.

            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The company needs to focus and encourage Long-term
                        subscriptions. Monthly subscription plans can be improved as well.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Customers should be encouraged to buy additional services like DSL in bundle packs as offers.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        As variables like gender and partner don't affect churn, the company shouldn't target
                        this specific segment as a means to reduce churn.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Senior Citizens should be provided additional support and plans (offers) to cater to their
                        needs.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Fibre optic internet services needs to be improved as it lead to higher churn rates.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        New offers and plans trying to reduce the total charges on the customer could be introduced.
